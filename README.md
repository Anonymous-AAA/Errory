# Errory
## Tired of executing testcases one by one for your assignmentðŸ¤¨ Here's a solution for that.
Errory is a quick and dirty python script to evaluate your  programming assignments. Just give your  zipped assignment and testcases file, it gives the error reports of mismatching test cases,compilation and runtime  errors.




## Getting Started

### Requirements

* Linux/WSL(Windows Subsystem for Linux)/Cygwin Terminal
* Python 3
* GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)
* GDB (optional)
* diff

I have tested the script on WSL, similar behavior is expected on Linux and Cygwin.
### Setting Up

* Download errory.py
* Place the script in the same folder as the zip files
* The program zip file should be according to the conventions provided by the evaluators.
* You can place the files in different folder, but then you would have to give the directory path instead of the file name in the command

### Executing program

* ASSGX_ROLLNO_FIRSTNAME.zip - Zip file containing c code (The filename should be according to the naming convention provided,X is any number)
* Testcases.zip - Zip file containing test cases ( The name of the zipfile has no format restrictions)
* Three options are given inside the python script file which the users can change : TIMEOUT, DELETE_TEMP_FILES and USE_GDB.
* TIMEOUT : Stops execution of the program if it takes more than TIMEOUT seconds to execute.This is considered as a runtime error as an occurence of non terminating program.
* DELETE_TEMP : If this option is set to True  it deletes the temporary files after execution, otherwise it will be  retained.
* USE_GDB : By setting this variable to True , the program will use GDB during runtime errors to give more information about the error. If you haven't installed GDB, set this option to False.

#### Shell Command for execution

```
python3 errory.py ASSG5_ROLLNO_FIRSTNAME.zip Testcases.zip
```

## Output

Compilation errors,Runtime errors(Along with timeout errors) and Mismatching testcases are stored in different files in the error_ASSGX_ subfolder. Mismatching testcases output file is actually the output of the diff command in Linux. To understand the output refer to a tutorial like this [one](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/diff-command-linux-examples/).

### Sample Output
```
Starting Execution 
The options set are:   
TIMEOUT: 30 seconds    
DELETE_TEMP_FILES: True
USE_GDB: True
Generating Report....  

Checking complete with 0 Compile errors, 4 Runtime errors(0 TIMEOUT errors) and 0 Test case mismatches
Check "error_ASSG5_" folder for detailed report
Happy Coding :)
```

### Sample runtime error file generated with GDB. (Other error files for compile and testcase mismatch errors  are also generated similarly)
